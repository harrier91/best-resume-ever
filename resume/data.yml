about: |
    Dynamic, open minded, fast learner and always ready to change: I consider these skills to be my strenghts.
    I always try to adapt myself because I think nothing is static in this World.

    I have a BSc in Electronic Engineering, an European MSc double degree in Advanced Robotics.
    I studied in 3 different Universities in Italy, Norway and France and I currently work in Switzerland as Software Engineer.

    Being social and get in touch with new people, from different cultures, in order to share knowledge and ideas, has always brought me inspiration and new ways of thinking.
